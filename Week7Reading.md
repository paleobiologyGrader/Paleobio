## Summary

This paper sets out to discuss the effect that lithification has on the availability of fossils and how this can change the fossil record. From the Late Miocene to the Pleistocene era, there was an increase in fossil diversity of three or fourfold. Hendy contests that the increase in diversity was not nearly as significant as previously believed and that the error came from changes in lithification skewing the data. This hypothesis is tested by sampling done in New Zealand from an assemblage of the Miocene to Pleistocene eras. 169 fossil samples were taken out of this area and analyzed.The samples were first placed into one of three categories: lithified, unlithified, and poorly lithified. This analysis then included looking at occurrence data, abundance, and finally looking at the mineralogy and the size of each of the samples. When looking at occurrence data, this study used the New Zealand Fossil Record File database. This was used as a baseline data set that Hendy could compare the data set that was obtained by sampling. When looking at diversity, early Pliocene and late Pliocene are compared and looked at the mean richness of these data sets. Finally, mineralogy and size were looked at to attempt to determine the cause of the differences in lithified and unlithified data sets. 

When looking at the data that had been collected and analyzed, results were able to be determined for abundance, diversity, as well as the cause for the difference in these categories. First, the increase in richness of the samples directly correlates with the decrease in lithification throughout the eras that were studied. Furthermore, when sampling efforts were standardized at a quota of 100 specimens, the unlithified samples yielded over double the amount of genera as the lithified samples. When time was eliminated as a potential confounding variable, we again saw that the lithified samples had a dramatically lower diversity, proving that sampling standardization alone can not rectify the higher levels of diversity in unlithified samples. When examining the causes of this difference, two factors were determined. First, because lithified fossils are more difficult to isolate, small, fragile fossils are frequently either overlooked or destroyed during sampling. Second, because the process of lithification involves carbonate sediment, we know that aragonite hardpoints in fossils may be destroyed. 

## Likes

One section in this paper that I found extremely clear, concise, and insightful was the explanation of the differences in diversity of samples due to their lithification. I enjoyed this because it looked passed the numbers that this study dealt with and was able to look at the physical and chemical process that leads to this change. I also thought that it was interesting because it factored in human error in the sampling that has taken place, where overlooking and destruction of small fossils takes place during the sampling process. 
````Furthermore, I thought that the observation that the aragonite destruction due to carbonate was very insightful.````
> I'm not quite sure what you mean by this? Do you mean the conversion from aragonite to calcite? We've talked about this a lot during class, don't forget!

I also thought that Hendy did a fantastic job of eliminating confounding variables from the study. He did a great job when considering standardization and when determining what samples should be taken within his study.

## Dislikes
I struggled to find things about this paper that I didnâ€™t like. The data, methods, and discussion were all very strong. However, one thing that I did not like about this paper is that the explanation of the FRF database. I would have like a lot more detail in how it was used and what the baseline that was gained from this database was obtained. This baseline is a very important part of the study and without knowing more about the process that was used it is hard to replicate the study.

## Figures 
Figure 1 shows diversity over the geologic time scale and the percent that was gained from lithified and unlithified or poorly lithified rock. Figure 2 shows richness versus the hardness of the sediment over time as well as the number of genera found in different levels of lithification. The first graph is very helpful because it shows how richness and lithification are directly proportional. Figure 3 is graphs of rarefaction of census counts in different lithification levels. Figure 4 is similar, except they are samples dominated by Tawera. I found these graphs poorly displayed because with the large amounts of curves on each graph, it was very hard to tell the bold lines from the thin lines. Figure 4 shows the percent of genera versus either the composition or size. These are both clear and well displayed. Table 1 displays data from the FRF as well as that from the collected information. It is well labeled and clear. Table 2 compares the mean sample diversity of different faunal lists.
